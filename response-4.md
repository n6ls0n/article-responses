“But the most influential innovation to come out of the brewery by far
has nothing to do with beer. It was the birthplace of the t-test, one of
the most important statistical techniques in all of science. When
scientists declare their findings “statistically significant,” they very
often use a t-test to make that determination.”

A short but interesting read about the origin’s of the t-test.

There's a saying that goes, "Necessity is the mother of invention" and that has been the case in my experience.

Other sayings along this line of thought include, "If you really want to get something done, set a deadline" , "When the going gets tough, the tough get going" and my personal favorite, "Buck or Buckle". The idea behind this is that sometimes for something great to happen, there needs to be a forcing function.

I think we can add the t-test to the list of examples that validate that idea.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions are highly appreciated.
