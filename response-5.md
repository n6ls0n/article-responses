“One of the most common pieces of advice I hear about git is “just learn
how the .git directory is structured and then you’ll understand
everything!“. I love understanding the internals of things more than
anyone, but there’s a LOT that “how the .git directory is structured”
doesn’t explain…”

A great and very concise blog post about the internals of the “.git”
folder. As the author mentions, it’s not an exhaustive summary but it
still covers a lot of important stuff.

Every developer should learn how to host their own git repo (and website
tbh). You’ll gain a deeper understanding of ‘git’ and the repo hosting
sites like GitHub and Gitlab (team GitHub but Gitlab has its merits
too), lose a lot of their mysticism.

At the end of the day, most SaaS companies are simplifying a process
and/or technology. Gaining a deeper understanding of said
process/technology lets you make better choices which in turn translates
positively on you and/or your company’s balance sheet.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated.
