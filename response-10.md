“So, you are probably that kind of developer. You know, the kind that
just has to have “localhost” served up with SSL. Even though you know
that you’re the CA, and you signed this SSL certificate yourself, and
you tweaked your browser and API client settings to accept the
certificate. But still, it just warms your heart to see a green lock in
your address bar rather than a red warning.”

A great tutorial about how to set up SSL certs on localhost.

It’s not the most beginner friendly but if you’ve ever set up SSL certs
for your own domain, this is should be a breeze.

The author uses Express as the server and for most cases that should be
fine but again if you have some experience in this domain, it shouldn’t
be hard to use a different server package.

Now you’re probably wondering how one would get experience with SSL
certs. The simplest way is to buy a domain and try to set up a website
yourself from scratch using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

I’d recommend the Digital Ocean series on setting up [NGINX on Ubuntu
22.04](<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-22-04>).
