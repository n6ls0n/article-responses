This was the article that I used to learn C along w/ K&R
<https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628>

It should be required reading for every experienced newcomer to the
language.

It gives you just the right amount of context to make you productive
from day one.
