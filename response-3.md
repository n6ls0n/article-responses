“So what is density really about, then? It’s about providing the highest
value outcomes in the smallest amount of time, space, pixels, and ink.”

I’ve never come across the term UI density but after reading this
article, it’s something we (developers) all implicitly consider when
designing UIs.

I tend to lean more sparse in my designs with features in place to allow
users get the info they need but after reading this article, I’ve
changed my perspective.

I don’t think the decision should be between sparse and dense designs
but should rather focus on the metrics the author proposes and try to
maximize those within the context of the application.

All in all, this is a great read and I’ve gotten some useful metrics
that can help me objectively decide on the best course of action when
posed with multiple options for a design decision.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated.
