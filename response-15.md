# Response-15

"This post will be about some source-level techniques for speeding up C++ compilation, and their (dis)advantages. It will not talk about things external to C++, such as buying better hardware, using a better build system, or using smarter linker."

Similar to my previous article response (see below for the link), there's a lot of hard-won knowledge in this article.

I'm a big fan of posts like this because whether we like it or not, software engineering is somewhat of a trade when it comes to how information is passed down. Yes, you can read books and watch tutorials (autodidacts unite!) but some stuff you only learn by doing it the wrong way and being corrected. Hell, sometimes you might do things the right way conventionally and within the context of the project it may not be the most optimal solution. Similar to how using AI properly super charges your coding workflow, reading articles like these has the same effect in a more general sense on your coding ability.

Seeing as [mulVid](https://mulvid.com/) is partly written in C++, I'll definitely be incorporating these techniques and I suggest reading the [series](https://codingnest.com/tag/the-little-things/) that this article is a part off if Cpp is part of your toolkit.

Finally, while this is for more seasoned Cpp devs, it's still good for beginners to read to get a sense of the things that come up once you graduate from "Hello World" single source file programs.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions are highly appreciated. Here's a link to the [previous article response](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-14.md).
