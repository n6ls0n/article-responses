“As a mediocre engineer, I took Internet and HTTPS communication for
granted and never dove any deeper. Today we’re improving as engineers
and learning a rough overview of how internet communication works,
specifically focusing on HTTP and TLS.”

A great introductory guide to how HTTPS works. Till this day, I’m
surprised by how many developers don’t even have a surface level
understanding of HTTPS and the various communication layers. It probably
comes down to incentives. If there is no direct reason the learn
something for your project/job most people don’t.

However, when you realize that a lot of tangential information may not
be useful in the obvious sense but will actually create a knowledge
matrix that makes you a better developer, you’ll start trying to learn
as much as you can.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated. Here's a link to the [previous article response](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-11.md).
