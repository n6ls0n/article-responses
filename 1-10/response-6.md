# Response-6

“Looking at fundamentals, you build your mental model on the truth
rather than on hypotheses constructed from evidence gathered while
experimenting with the API. This truer model gives you a better
understanding of what Git has done, what it is doing, and what it will
do.”

Following on from [response-5](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-5.md) about “.git” folder internals,
this blog post dives into what exactly happens throughout the lifecycle
of your project from the perspective of Git. Think of it like a
play-by-play of the inner workings of Git along with a graph
visualization.

I can’t state how useful this is.

Wrapping your head around Git will make your onboarding experience on
any team 10x easier because all you have to learn at that point is the
specific processes of the team. I honestly wish I had had this when I
was starting out and I’m definitely adding this to my list of required
reading for developers.

The cherry on the cake is that the author has written her own
implementation of Git in JavaScript (with loads and loads of helpful
comments and annotations).

If you fancy learning more about Git, I would highly recommend this.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated.
