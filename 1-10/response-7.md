“The absence of a centralized, up-to-date repository for the
specification complicates matters. While some clarifications and
consensus have been reached within the generic-abi group, accessing the
latest, definitive text remains a challenge.”

An interesting history of the ELF object file format. Useful article in
and of itself but the links contained within are just as insightful.

The interesting thing about this article is that I didn’t realize ELF
was another example of [xkcd 2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/). The author
has some ideas for remedying this which I think are feasible and I hope
do get implemented. Something this important should be actively
maintained.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated. Here's a link to the [previous article response](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-6.md).
