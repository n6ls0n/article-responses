“A lot of new CSS features have shipped in the last years, but actual
usage is still low. While there are many different reasons for the slow
adoption, I think one of the biggest barriers are our own brains.”

THIS -> “My preferred way of learning new techniques like that is by
tinkering with stuff in the safe playground of a side project or a
personal site. After some trial and error, a pattern might emerge there
that sort of feels right. And if enough people agree on a pattern, it
could even become a more common convention.”

In this article, the author talks about all the new CSS features that
developers have available to them which aren’t being used.

He gives a few reasons why these features don’t seem to be so readily
adopted including the “support” excuse, the lack of a visible
improvement in workflow and IMO the most important reason being muscle
memory. If you can already solve a problem one way, solving it in a more
efficient way would actually be less efficient for you in the short
term. In other words, it’s as much about the workman as it is about the
tool.

All in all, a great article to chew on both for the knowledge and the
philosophical questions it poses about using new features of a familiar
tool.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
