MBPC (Margin, Border, Padding, Content)

<https://www.saturdayfrontend.com/p/css-makes-sense-understanding-this>

A short article about HTML elements from the view of CSS. The author
discusses the essential components (MPBC) to keep in mind when styling
HTML elements which are:

Margin

Border

Padding

Content

They also include a nice graphic to help visualize how all four are
connected. I think this is very useful for junior developers but I think
a lot of seasoned developers will still find this useful as a reference.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated. Here's a link to the [previous article response](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-7.md).
