When it comes to the current path were are on with AI, I think we are in
a local minima and an AI winter may not be as far away as we think.

Why?

Because modern models consume too much energy during training.

I think the key to circumventing this issue may be to move from
silicon-based computing to biological computing.

The article below gives a good overview of the players in the field

And the link at the very top is a company that has actually got
something up and running.

Moral and legal ramifications aside, I’m really interested to see how
this plays out over the next few years.

It’s not quite mainstream yet and I don’t think it will be until we max
out compute on Silicon.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated.
