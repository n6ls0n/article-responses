"Now, in a world where AI is replacing programmers by the minute, taking their jobs and revolutionizing the way we think about code, maybe we should be more open to the thoughts of the fresh new blood of the industry? In fact, the above code is a perfect example of a time-memory tradeoff. Youâ€™re trading off your time and at the same time, the computers memory and time as well! Truly a marvelous algorithm!"

Brief but amazing read.

Hidden beneath the snark and sarcasm[^1], is a lot of applied knowledge that you can only get by reading the right book or working with the right people. The author shows one way AI can super charge your coding workflow by providing exact code for an unfamiliar domain, talks about leveraging assembly knowledge to craft your code the way you want and also touches on some memory-management magic. The memory managment stuff was a bit new to me but after some conversations with Claude and o1, I now have a few new tools in my arsenal.

Something else that is evident even though he doesn't explicitly say it is that at the end of the day, languages, compilers, AI etc. are just tools to get you where you need to go. When you understand the strengths of each tool, you can mix and match  based the  constraints and requirements of your projects.

Thanks for reading and as always, all comments, critiques and questions
are highly appreciated. Here's a link to the [previous article response](https://github.com/n6ls0n/article-responses/blob/master/response-13.md).
